# GameDev
Year 3 Game development project


Third Party Assets:

 The project was first built by following a fantastic tutorial from GamesPlusJames: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZzf1FQQFA0
 While the project does stem from the building of the tutorial, so much has been edited and changed. Some structures look similar but have been developed and also any code which
 similar or inspired by the tutorial has been acknowledged in comments.
